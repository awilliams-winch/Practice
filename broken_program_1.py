# A Very Broken Program 
#
# The following program is very buggy! It does not have the desired output.
# Can you identify the errors in the program and fix them?
#


# Part 1: A Broken Madlib

# The following lines should take input from the user and assign them to variables
place = input("Albania")
adjective = "Give me an adjective"
emotion <= input("Give me an emotion")
ing_verb = input("doing"")
noun = noun

# The following should concatenate the variables above into lines in the Madlib
line1 = "Today, I went to <place>. It was very " adjective_1
line 2 = "When I arrived, I felt" + emotion
line3 = "I spent the day " (ing_verb) " to the " + noun

# Then, print the lines of the Madlib
print(line1 line2 line_3) 




# Part 2: A broken math problem

# The following lines should take two inputs from the user and convert them to ints
int_1 = str(input('Give me an integer please'))
int_2 = int(input('Give me another integer please')

#Take the two inputs and perform basic operations on them together
sum = int1 + int_2
difference = int_1 -- int_2
product = int_1 ** int_2
quotient = int_1 / int_2

#Print the answer as integers
print(sum)
print difference
print("product")
print(quotient)
